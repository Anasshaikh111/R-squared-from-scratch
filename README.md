### This project demonstrates how to manually implement simple linear regression in Python to calculate the R² (coefficient of determination) — a statistical measure that indicates how well the regression predictions approximate the actual data points.

#### First, it calculates the mean of the input (X) and output (Y) values.
#### Then, it computes the slope (m) and intercept (c) of the best-fit line using basic statistical formulas.
#### With the line equation 𝑦=𝑚𝑥+𝑐
#### y=mx+c, the model predicts values for the given X inputs.
#### Finally, it calculates the R² score using:

#### SSres is the residual sum of squares (errors between actual and predicted values).
#### SStot is the total sum of squares (variation of actual values from the mean).
### A higher R² (close to 1) means a better fit between your model and the data.
### This project helps users understand the core mechanics behind linear regression and R² without using external libraries like NumPy or scikit-learn.
